# Airwallex Homework Demo

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Template: Typescript 

## Notes
I take this part forward to make it striking.

- Webpack Changes

Add exclude rules for stories.ts

- Http Request

Use axios and not encapsulated. 

- Unit Test

Not used.

- Router

use React Router.

- State Management

Not involved.

- i18n / Static Content
Not involved.

- UI Components 
Use material UI

- Responsive
Use material UI and seems not bad.

- Storybook
Add a stories file for DialogTitle.tsx

- Styles Support
Sass/Scss

- Header Not Floatting on Page
I use 'position: abosulte;' instead of 'position: sticky;' because there's no scene for scrolling the page.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
